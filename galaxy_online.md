# Galaxy and Python online course

The training course will introduce the [Galaxy framework](https://usegalaxy.org) and [Python](www.python.org). 

## Motivation

Life sciences used to be all about wet-lab expertise. Due to fast technical innovations and digitalisation we are now facing the challenge of dealing with vasts amounts of data. Analyses of such data requires advanced statistics and specialized tools to run analyses and to visualize both data and results. Science becomes more and more dependent on bioinformaticians and computer scientists, which creates the additional challenge of interdisciplinary communication. This course introduces Galaxy, an open source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research and a brief introduction to Python, interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. You can chose to use this course as a stepping stone into advanced analyses or as an opportunity to learn what your bioinformatician of trust is actually doing. Further courses and tutorials for Galaxy and Python are widely available. Both Galaxy and Python have active user communities, making self-paced learning possible.

**Galaxy**
 is a scientific workflow, data integration, and data analysis platform that aims to make computational biology accessible to research scientists that do not have extended computer programming experience. It was initially developed for genomics research and grew into a general bioinformatics workflow management system. It's intended use supports the accessibility, reproducibility and trasparency of research.

**Python**
 is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It's design emphasizes code readability and supports the use of clear and logically written code. Applications of Python transcends life sciences and are used by large organizations, such as Wikipedia, Google, NASA, Spotify and many more. Jupyter Notebooks contain both code and text elements. Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (including figures and tables) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

**Learning goals:**
- Know your data, and the implications of data preprocessing and quality control
- Understand the general use, advantages and disadvantages of Python and more specifically Jupyter Notebooks.

**Prerequisites:**
This workshop is intended for PhD students with a background in medicine, engineering and life science research. In order to take part in the hands-on session we recommend one Laptop/PC and a stable internet connection.
We further ask you to create a [Galaxy account](https://usegalaxy.org/login) beforehand.

Please let us know if you have issues setting up your accounts, before the beggining of session 1.
