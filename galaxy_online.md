# Introduction to Galaxy and Python with Jupyter Notebook

Life sciences used to be all about wet-lab expertise. Due to fast technical
innovations and digitalisation we are now facing the challenge of dealing with
vasts amounts of data. Analyses of such data requires advanced statistics and
specialized tools to run analyses and to visualize both data and results.
Science becomes more and more dependent on bioinformaticians and computer
scientists, which creates the additional challenge of interdisciplinary
communication.  
This course introduces the [Galaxy framework](https://usegalaxy.eu), an open
source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research, [Python](https://www.python.org),
an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language, and
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), a multi-language framework for
interactive computing.  

You can chose to use this course as a stepping stone into advanced analyses,
or as an opportunity to learn what your bioinformatician of trust is actually
doing.  
Further courses and tutorials for Galaxy and Python are widely available. Both
Galaxy and Python have active user communities, making self-paced learning
possible.

## Prerequisites

This workshop is intended for PhD students with a background in medicine,
engineering and life science research.  
In order to take part in the hands-on session we recommend one Laptop/PC and a
stable internet connection.  
We further ask you to create a [Galaxy account](https://usegalaxy.eu/login)
beforehand.  

_Please let us know if you have issues setting up your accounts, before the
beginning of session 1._

## Tools

**Galaxy**: Galaxy is a scientific workflow management system, data
integration, and data analysis platform that aims to make computational biology
accessible to research scientists that do not have extended computer
programming experience.  
Galaxy was initially developed for genomics research and grew into a framework
for biomedical data analysis. It's intended use supports the accessibility,
reproducibility and trasparency of research.  

**Python**: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It's
syntax emphasizes code readability and supports the use of clear and logically
written algorithms.  
Applications of Python transcends life sciences and are used by large
organizations, such as Wikipedia, Google, NASA, Spotify and many more.  

**Jupyter Notebooks**: a multi-language platform for interactive computing.
Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis
description and the results (including figures and tables) as well as
executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.
