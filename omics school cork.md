# Omics Training Cork

The training course will introduce basic concepts of systems biology, network analysis, network visualisation and the [Galaxy framework](https://usegalaxy.org). 

Learning goals:
- Understand the motivation behind systems biology approaches
- Know basic systems biology terminologies
- Understand the systems biology workflow
- Calculate network topological parameters
- Find critical nodes in the network
- Identify the regulatory core from a large network
- Know your data, and the implications of data preprocessing and quality control
- Performing differential gene expression analysis using Galaxy
- Visualize a network
- 

Prerequisites:
This workshop is intended for PhD students with a background in medicine, engineering and life science research.
