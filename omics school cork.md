# Omics Training Cork
## Galaxy for linking bisulfite sequencing with RNA sequencing

The training course will introduce basic concepts of systems biology, network analysis, network visualisation and the [Galaxy framework](https://usegalaxy.org).
, and showcase its tools for data handling and preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, bisulfite sequencing analysis, and Oxford Nanopore data exploration and usage.  
Lectures will be provided on the topics of RNA and Bisulfite sequencing, Epigenetics, and basic statistics, and followed by hands-on sessions. Finally, we will showcase a Galaxy Docker installation for customized workflow analysis.

Learning goals:
- Understand the concepts of systems biology and how they enable us to analyze and interprete data 
- Know your data, and the implications of data preprocessing and quality control
- Performing differential gene expression analysis using Galaxy
- visualize a network


Prerequisites:
This workshop is intended for PhD students with a background in medicine, engineering and life science research.
